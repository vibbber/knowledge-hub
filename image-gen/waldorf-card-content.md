## steiner-education-of-the-child

```typescript
// color-environment-temperament
cardName: 'Waldorf Color Therapy',
oneLiner: 'Calm your restless child with counterintuitive room colors',
forProblems: 'Restless, overstimulated children who can\'t settle; lethargic, low-energy kids who won\'t engage',
approach: 'Surround excitable children with red (creates calming green internally) and lethargic children with blue (creates energizing orange). The opposite of intuition.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1907), based on complementary color physiology - verifiable by staring at red then looking at white',
inside: 'Temperament identification guide, complementary color pairs table, application areas (walls, bedding, clothing), common mistake warning',
```

```typescript
// imagination-building-toys
cardName: 'Waldorf Toy Selection',
oneLiner: 'A napkin doll builds brains; a perfect doll stunts them',
forProblems: 'Too many toys but no imaginative play; kids bored by expensive toys; concern about screen alternatives',
approach: 'Choose unfinished toys that require imagination to complete. The work of imagining shapes the brain\'s physical structures before age 7.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1907), Waldorf education tradition, developmental science on imagination and neural development',
inside: 'Good toy list (cloth dolls, wooden figures, natural materials), bad toy list (realistic dolls, electronic toys), the Imagination Test for buying decisions',
```

```typescript
// mother-father-inheritance
cardName: 'Waldorf Inheritance Pattern',
oneLiner: 'Know which parent gave what - and what\'s purely your child',
forProblems: 'Confused why your child is so different from you; wondering where talents/interests come from; same-sex parent friction',
approach: 'Intelligence quality comes from mother, will/character from father - but direction of talent and interest is the child\'s own individuality.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1910), includes Goethe case study and observable parent-child patterns',
inside: 'What\'s inherited vs individual chart, why same-sex parenting is harder, the danger of mismatched interest and talent',
```

```typescript
// past-memory-discipline
cardName: 'Waldorf Memory Discipline',
oneLiner: 'Discuss the misbehavior weeks later - when defenses are down',
forProblems: 'In-the-moment correction creates resistance; power struggles during discipline; lectures that don\'t stick',
approach: 'Wait until feelings have faded but memory remains. The child can examine behavior objectively without emotional armor.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1910), insight that "feelings become numb and go a very different way than thoughts and memory"',
inside: '5-step method (contain, wait, connect, recall, discuss), present vs past correction comparison, character-building effects',
```

```typescript
// steiner-three-births-framework
cardName: 'Waldorf Three Births',
oneLiner: 'Different ages need completely different parenting approaches',
forProblems: 'Wondering when to teach what; feeling like methods stopped working; unsure what\'s age-appropriate',
approach: 'Children have three births: physical (0), etheric at 7 (teeth), astral at puberty. Each stage has magic words: Imitation, Authority, then Judgment.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1907), century of Waldorf school implementation, observable developmental markers',
inside: 'What works and what harms at each stage, observable markers for transitions, core warning about early judgment',
```

```typescript
// what-we-forget-becomes-us
cardName: 'Waldorf Forgotten Experiences',
oneLiner: 'The atmosphere of childhood becomes their character',
forProblems: 'Worried early experiences won\'t matter; unsure what really shapes a child; questioning value of stories and environment',
approach: 'Experiences children forget don\'t disappear - they transform into moods, courage, and fundamental orientation to life.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1911), insight that "we are essentially made up of what we have forgotten"',
inside: 'What forgotten experiences become (chart), why early childhood matters most, 5 implications for parents',
```

## steiner-kingdom-of-childhood

```typescript
// nine-year-change-crisis
cardName: 'Waldorf Nine-Year Crisis',
oneLiner: 'When your 9-year-old suddenly questions everything you are',
forProblems: 'Around age 9: new loneliness, questioning authority, testing boundaries in unfamiliar ways, asking about death',
approach: 'The child separates self from world for the first time. Respond with warmth and sincerity, not explanations. Quality over content.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1924), developmental milestone observed across Waldorf schools for 100 years',
inside: 'Signs the change is happening, wrong vs right response comparison, what\'s at stake if handled poorly, teaching adjustments after',
```

```typescript
// three-school-periods
cardName: 'Waldorf Three School Periods',
oneLiner: 'If children are tired after lessons, you taught wrong',
forProblems: 'Kids exhausted by school; wondering when to introduce subjects; abstract learning failing young children',
approach: 'Three periods (7-9, 9.5-11.7, 11.7-14) each need different content. Match teaching to the child\'s current consciousness.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1924), Waldorf curriculum design, insight that the rhythmic system (engaged by pictures) never tires',
inside: 'Three-period breakdown with teaching methods, subject age-gating table (when to introduce grammar, physics, etc.)',
```

```typescript
// waldorf-arithmetic-whole-parts
cardName: 'Waldorf Whole-to-Parts Math',
oneLiner: 'Start with 12, ask what parts make it - not 3+4+5=?',
forProblems: 'Math feels abstract and meaningless; child struggles with arithmetic; disconnect between numbers and real life',
approach: 'Always start from the whole and divide. Never build parts to reach a whole. Numbers derive from the body, not abstract counters.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1924), insight that "the body is always doing mathematics" - counting on fingers is connecting to bodily knowing',
inside: 'All four operations reversed (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), deriving numbers from the body, Pythagorean theorem example',
```

```typescript
// waldorf-form-body-exercises
cardName: 'Waldorf Body-Mind Exercises',
oneLiner: 'Touch your left ear with your right hand - fast!',
forProblems: 'Developing thinking through the body; coordination and spatial awareness; alternative to head-only learning',
approach: 'Quick, alert exercises requiring children to think about their bodies. Form completion drawing. Color harmony discovery.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1924), observation that "wisdom at 35-36 connects to exercises done at 6-7"',
inside: 'Form completion exercises with diagrams, cross-body touch commands, circle exercises, finger exercises, color harmony painting',
```

```typescript
// waldorf-writing-from-pictures
cardName: 'Waldorf Picture Writing',
oneLiner: 'M comes from mouth, S from snake - letters aren\'t arbitrary',
forProblems: 'Child sees letters as meaningless symbols; early reading struggles; disengagement from writing practice',
approach: 'Never teach letters as abstract symbols. Paint the mouth, say "mmm," discover how lips make the M shape. Writing before reading.',
evidence: 'Rudolf Steiner (1924), based on how letters actually evolved historically from pictographs',
inside: '5-step method, consonant examples (M from mouth, F from fish, S from snake), vowel examples from gestures, sequence: Life to Picture to Writing to Reading',
```
